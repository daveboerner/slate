# Introduction

Particle Health supports a RESTful Web Service based off the FHIR and CCDA standards. We expose an API by which verified customers (data seekers) may access health records for over 250M unique patients across the U.S. 

By simply requesting information with a minimum set of demographic parameters, Particle is able to query partner Health Information Networks (data holders), producing aggregated data in a seamless, efficient and HIPAA compliant manner. 

Particle has designed this process with security, simplicity and elegance as central tenets. What took numerous coordinated IHE and RESTful queries across numerous networks has been distilled to a simple API to access data across the health ecosystem - regardless of geographic boundaries or vendor systems. 

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://api.particlehealth.com/particle-sandbox-api/api/v1/queries"
  -H "Authorization: 5de5589d735a4100016f0ecc6b4c9f1ea0be4e6d99c03f075c2f34d1"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
